/*
Master Oogway is full of wisdom and not shy of empathy. He will often give a suitably reassuring quote when an issue is presented to him. 

However, recently Oogway has faced much criticism over his selection of the dragon warrior. He does not like to even hear the words, and will shun you if they are mentioned.

Write a function that will take two inputs:
  problem - the issue proposed to Oogway.
  response - the exclamtory response to the problem.

  The function must return a string from Oogway, with an exclamation mark to show his enthusiasm - however, if the string already ends with an exclamation mark, do not add another. If the dragon warrior is mentioned in any form, return "DO NOT QUESTION MY CHOICE OF THE DRAGON WARRIOR!"

e.g. if "I lost my maths homework and got told off" is input as problem, return "There are no accidents!"
e.g. if "I should be the new Dragon Warrior" is input as problem, return "DO NOT QUESTION MY CHOICE OF THE DRAGON WARRIOR!"
e.g. if "WhY aM I nOt thE DrAGon WaRRiOR?" is input, return "DO NOT QUESTION MY CHOICE OF THE DRAGON WARRIOR!"

Enjoy!
